// Write a menu driven program in C, which will develop a restricted array in which we can insert or remove an
// item at the top of the array only(Here top is a special index).In a normal array, we can access any of its elements
//  using indexing, but here we can only access the top most element in the array using top index.The top index is initialized to - 1.
//  Every time you will insert in this array by incrementing top by one while you can delete an element from this array by decreasing top by one.
//  You will add 4 operations with respect to this restricted array.These are(1) insert(2) delete(3)array - empty(4) array - full.
