// Write a C program to implement the Number Guessing Game. In this game the
// computer has saved a four digit number. the player tries to guess the number in
// maximum 5 few attempts. Each time the player enters a guess, the computer
// tells him how many correct digits he/she has entered and in proper position.
// Once the player guesses the number, the game is over.
// As for example: if the original number is 4321 and player guesses 1304 then
// computer will answer three digits(1,3,4) are correct and one digit (3) is in
// proper position.
