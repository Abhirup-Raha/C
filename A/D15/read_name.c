// Read full name of any person (say, Sagarika Sen) and perform the following:
// a) Greet the person with &quot;Hello&quot;. (i.e., Output is: Hello Sagarika Sen )
// b) Greet the person with &quot;Hello&quot; and her first name. (i.e., Output is: Hello Sagarika )
// c) Greet the person with &quot;Hello&quot; and her last name. (i.e., Output is: Hello Ms. Sen )
// Note : Here Hello will be stored in one string and person’s name will be stored in
//        another string.You may use
//        gets(str_name) to read a string having blank space.
//        Alternatively, you may use the following code to use scanf() for the same purpose.
//        scanf(&quot;%[^\n]s&quot;, str_name);
//        // str_name is the name of the character array
