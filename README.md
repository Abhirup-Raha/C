## Prerequisites

You will need the following tools installed on your system to run these programs:

* Any Code Editor you like we prefer [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

* setup C compiler, we prefer [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/)    

    [You can follow this tutorial to install gcc in vscode for windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ubfgi4NoTPk)

* Lastly make sure you have prettier extension installed in vscode for formatting
    [here is how you can do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__eiQumLOEo)

    you are now ready to contribute ;)
## Contributing

- Navigate to the specified folder the format is section name and then day name
    
    (any extra programs should be written in the extra folder under the specified concept)

    Example:
    ```
     A/D1 would contain Section A Day 1 programs
    ```
-   Write the question using comment lines and then code 
    if possible display the result in comment lines.

     Example

```C
// Convert Farenheit to Celcius
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    float fahrenheit, celcius;

    printf("Enter temp in farenheit\n");
    scanf("%f", &fahrenheit);

    celcius = (5.0 / 9) * (fahrenheit - 32);

    printf("The temperature in celcius is %f Â°", celcius);

    return 0;
}
/*
Enter temp in farenheit
32
The temperature in celcius is 0.000000
*/

```

-   Use suitable comment lines.

-   There's no restriction on your approach to solve.

-   Maintain readability(use appropriate variable names and comments)
